# Volt — Phase 2 Acceptance Gates

**Phase 2 Theme: Execution integrity + user-visible trust**

Phase 1 proved Volt is real.
Phase 2 must prove Volt is safe to operate.

No new "big features."
Only things that make the system reliable, inspectable, and bounded.

## Gate 1 — Build & Test Integrity (ENFORCED)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Goal:** Any clone builds and tests cleanly, deterministically.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `dotnet build` succeeds from repo root
- [x] `dotnet test` passes all test projects
- [x] No warnings elevated to errors unless explicitly justified
- [x] No `bin/` or `obj/` artifacts committed
- [x] `.gitignore` present and effective
- [x] `scripts/verify.ps1` and `scripts/verify.sh` provide CI-equivalent local run

### Evidence

**Verified: 2026-02-02**

- **Build**: All projects compile (Volt.Core, Volt.Inference, Volt.Services, Volt.ViewModels, Volt.App + 3 test projects)
- **Tests**: 185 tests pass across 3 test projects
- **Verify scripts**: `scripts/verify.ps1` and `scripts/verify.sh` clean, restore, build, and test
- **Clean repo**: `.gitignore` properly excludes build artifacts

### Why This Gate Exists

Volt cannot earn trust if it can't be rebuilt by a stranger.

---

## Gate 2 — Test Coverage Floor (ENFORCED)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Goal:** Core logic is meaningfully protected.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Coverage collection enabled (Coverlet)
- [x] `scripts/coverage.ps1` and `scripts/coverage.sh` generate reports
- [x] Threshold enforcement infrastructure in place
- [x] tests/Directory.Build.props configures coverlet.collector

### Evidence

**Verified: 2026-02-02**

| Project | Tests | Key Coverage Areas |
|---------|-------|-------------------|
| Volt.Core.Tests | 98 | Errors, State, Models, Serialization, Trust |
| Volt.Services.Tests | 68 | Storage, Health (6 files, 42 tests) |
| Volt.Inference.Tests | 19 | FakeInferenceClient, HealthCheckResult |

Key tested areas:
- Result<T> pattern with Map/Bind/Match operations
- VoltError taxonomy (30+ error codes)
- StateSerializer round-trip (Message, Conversation, AppState)
- FileStore path boundary enforcement
- HealthService probe aggregation
- TrustReport serialization

### Why This Gate Exists

Phase 2 is where regressions start to matter.

---

## Gate 3 — Execution Boundary Enforcement (ENFORCED)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Goal:** Volt must not perform uncontrolled side effects.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All external effects routed through explicit service interfaces
- [x] File system access isolated via `IFileStore` with path allowlist
- [x] Inference calls isolated behind `IInferenceClient`
- [x] Path traversal attacks blocked (tested)
- [x] FakeInferenceClient enables testing without network

### Evidence

**Verified: 2026-02-02**

**FileStore (Volt.Services.Storage)**
- Path validation rejects `..` traversal and absolute paths
- All operations return `Result<T>` for safe error handling
- Tests verify path blocking (9 boundary tests)

**IInferenceClient (Volt.Inference.Interfaces)**
- All network calls go through this interface
- FakeInferenceClient provides complete test double
- No direct HttpClient usage outside inference layer

### Why This Gate Exists

This is what separates "app" from "safe system."

---

## Gate 4 — Deterministic State & Persistence (ENFORCED)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Goal:** Volt state is predictable and inspectable.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Single source of truth for Conversations, Messages, ModelSelection
- [x] State transitions are explicit (factory methods)
- [x] State is serializable with round-trip tests
- [x] No hidden mutable globals
- [x] AppState is immutable with With* methods

### Evidence

**Verified: 2026-02-02**

**State Models (Volt.Core.State)**
- `AppState` — root container with `WithConversation()`, `WithUpdatedConversation()`, `WithoutConversation()`
- `ModelSelectionState` — selected model, backend, available models
- All use `required` properties and immutable collections

**Serialization (StateSerializer)**
- Deterministic JSON (property ordering, camelCase)
- Round-trip tests for all state types
- Returns `Result<T>` for safe deserialization
- Compact mode for storage efficiency

### Why This Gate Exists

Debugging without state determinism is a dead end.

---

## Gate 5 — Health, Errors, and Failure Clarity (ENFORCED)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Goal:** Failure is visible and understandable.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Structured error types with codes
- [x] Result<T> pattern for safe error propagation
- [x] Health check system with probes
- [x] No swallowed exceptions in health checks (caught and reported)
- [x] Actionable error messages with suggestions

### Evidence

**Verified: 2026-02-02**

**Error Taxonomy (Volt.Core.Errors)**
- `ErrorCode` enum with 30+ categorized codes
- `VoltError` record with Code, Message, Detail, Suggestions, Severity
- Factory methods: `ConnectionFailed`, `ModelNotFound`, `PathNotAllowed`, `Timeout`
- `Result<T>` with Map/Bind/Match for monadic error handling

**Health System (Volt.Services.Health)**
- `IHealthCheck` interface with Name, Category, CheckAsync
- `HealthProbeResult` with Healthy/Degraded/Unhealthy status
- `HealthReport` aggregates probes with overall status
- `HealthService` runs all probes, catches exceptions, returns reports
- Concrete checks: InferenceHealthCheck, StorageHealthCheck, AppHealthCheck

### Why This Gate Exists

Silent failure is worse than loud failure.

---

## Gate 6 — Architecture Lock (HUMAN-VERIFIED)

**Status:** ⏳ AWAITING SIGN-OFF

**Goal:** Prevent Phase 3 scope creep disguised as refactors.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `ARCHITECTURE.md` updated to Phase 2 state
- [x] Explicit out-of-scope list
- [x] Explicit extension points
- [x] Explicit non-goals
- [ ] Human sign-off

### Evidence

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for complete Phase 2 architecture documentation.

### Why This Gate Exists

Most projects die here. This gate prevents that.

---

## Gate 7 — User-Visible Trust Signals (ENFORCED)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED

**Goal:** Users can tell Volt is behaving correctly.

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] BuildInfo record with version, commit, timestamp, configuration
- [x] TrustReport aggregates build, runtime, and security info
- [x] TrustLevel computed (High/Medium/Low)
- [x] SecurityConfig tracks path boundary, inference isolation
- [x] Reports are serializable for display/logging

### Evidence

**Verified: 2026-02-02**

**Trust Infrastructure (Volt.Core.Trust)**
- `BuildInfo` — version, informational version, commit hash, build timestamp, configuration
- `RuntimeInfo` — framework, OS, architecture, process details
- `SecurityConfig` — path boundary enforced, inference isolated, telemetry enabled
- `TrustReport` — combines all with computed trust level and summary
- `TrustLevel` enum: High (all secure), Medium (some disabled), Low (multiple issues)

Tests verify serialization and trust level computation.

### Why This Gate Exists

Trust is built in moments of waiting and failure.

---

## Phase 2 Completion Definition

Phase 2 is complete when:

1. All **ENFORCED** gates pass automatically ✅
2. All **HUMAN-VERIFIED** gates are signed off ⏳
3. No new features were added unless required to satisfy a gate ✅

At that point, Volt becomes:

> **Operationally credible**
>
> Not polished.
> Not scaled.
> But safe, explainable, and trustworthy.

---

## Phase 2 Non-Goals

- Multi-user support
- Cloud sync or backup
- Plugin/extension system
- Custom model training or fine-tuning
- Voice input/output
- Cross-platform support
- Web interface
- Mobile companion app
- Ollama installation/management (user responsibility)
