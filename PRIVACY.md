# Privacy Policy for InControl-Desktop

**Last Updated: February 3, 2026**

## Overview

InControl-Desktop is a local AI chat assistant that runs entirely on your Windows device. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## Data Collection

**InControl-Desktop does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

### What stays on your device:
- All conversations and chat history
- Your settings and preferences
- AI model files
- Session data

### What we do NOT collect:
- Personal information
- Usage analytics
- Conversation content
- Telemetry data
- Location data
- Device identifiers

## Local Processing

All AI inference is performed locally on your device using Ollama. Your conversations never leave your computer. There are no cloud services, no accounts required, and no data synchronization.

## Network Connections

InControl-Desktop may make the following optional network connections:

1. **Ollama Model Downloads** - When you choose to download AI models, the app connects to Ollama's model registry. This is initiated only by your explicit action.

2. **Update Checks** - If enabled, the app may check for updates through the Microsoft Store infrastructure.

No conversation data or personal information is transmitted during these connections.

## Data Storage

All application data is stored locally in:
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\InControl\` - Application settings and logs
- Ollama's default model storage location

You can delete all application data by uninstalling the app and removing the above folder.

## Third-Party Services

InControl-Desktop integrates with:
- **Ollama** - Local AI inference engine (runs on your device)

We do not integrate with any cloud AI services or analytics platforms.

## Children's Privacy

InControl-Desktop does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
