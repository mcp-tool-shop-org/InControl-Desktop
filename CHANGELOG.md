# Changelog

All notable changes to InControl-Desktop will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- Shipcheck compliance: SHIP_GATE.md, SCORECARD.md
- Updated SECURITY.md with current version and data scope
- Security & Data Scope section in README

## [1.3.0]

### Changed
- App version bump to 1.3.0

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-12

### InControl.Core

#### Added
- **`IAsyncDisposable` on `PluginHost`** — new `DisposeAsync()` properly awaits async plugin disposal; sync `Dispose()` retained for backward compatibility
- **`TryProposeAction` on `ToolApprovalManager`** — `Result<ToolProposal>`-returning alternative to the throwing `ProposeAction`, unifies the error-handling pattern
- **`IDataPathsProvider` interface + `DataPathsProvider`** — DI-friendly path resolution; register as `services.AddSingleton<IDataPathsProvider, DataPathsProvider>()`
- **`DataPaths.Configure(DataPathsConfig)`** — override default paths for testing and custom deployments; `ResetConfiguration()` for test cleanup
- **`Result<T>.Unwrap()`** — non-nullable value accessor for value-type `T` where `MemberNotNullWhen` cannot narrow `T?` to `T`

#### Fixed
- **`PluginHost.Dispose()` bare catch** narrowed to `catch (Exception)` for explicit best-effort semantics
- **`DataPaths` internal routing** now uses `CurrentConfig` indirection, enabling `Configure()` overrides to take effect on all path properties and methods

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-12

### InControl.Core

#### Fixed
- **ConfigureAwait(false)** added to all async methods across 9 files — prevents potential UI deadlocks when Core is consumed by WinUI/WPF callers
- **DiagnosticsReport.ToJson()** now reuses `StateSerializer` options instead of allocating new `JsonSerializerOptions` per call
- **ToolRegistry audit log** capped at 10,000 entries (trims oldest 1,000) — prevents unbounded memory growth in long-running sessions
- **PolicyEngine regex caching** — glob-to-regex patterns are compiled once and cached in a `ConcurrentDictionary`, eliminating redundant `Regex.Escape` + `Regex.IsMatch` on every policy evaluation
- **DataPaths.ClearTemp / GetDirectorySize** bare `catch {}` narrowed to `catch (IOException)` — no longer silently swallows `OutOfMemoryException`, `ThreadAbortException`, etc.
- **SecurityConfig** modernized from `Array.Empty<string>()` to `[]` collection expressions
