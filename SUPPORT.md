## Frequently Asked Questions

### General

**Q: Does InControl-Desktop require internet access?**

A: No. InControl-Desktop is designed to work completely offline. Internet connectivity is:
- Disabled by default
- Only enabled through explicit operator action
- Fully auditable when enabled
- Revocable at any time

**Q: Where is my data stored?**

A: All data is stored locally on your device:
- Conversations: `%LocalAppData%\InControl-Desktop\data`
- Settings: `%LocalAppData%\InControl-Desktop\settings.json`
- Logs: `%LocalAppData%\InControl-Desktop\logs`

**Q: Can I export my conversations?**

A: Yes. Go to Settings → Export to save your conversations as JSON files.

### Ollama Connection

**Q: Why can't InControl connect to Ollama?**

A: Common causes:
1. Ollama isn't running (`ollama serve` in terminal)
2. Ollama is on a different port (check Settings → Ollama URL)
3. Firewall blocking localhost connections
4. Ollama crashed (check Ollama logs)

**Q: Which models work with InControl?**

A: Any Ollama-compatible model. Recommended:
- `llama3.2` - Good balance of speed and quality
- `qwen2.5` - Excellent for coding tasks
- `mistral` - Fast responses

### Updates

**Q: How do I update InControl-Desktop?**

A: By default, updates are manual:
1. Download the new version from Releases
2. Install over the existing version
3. Your data and settings are preserved

You can enable update notifications in Settings → Updates.

**Q: Can I go back to a previous version?**

A: Yes. Previous versions are always available in the Releases archive. Note:
- Settings may need to reset if formats changed
- Conversations are preserved across versions

### Performance

**Q: Why is generation slow?**

A: Check:
1. Your GPU is being used (Settings → Show GPU stats)
2. Model isn't too large for your VRAM
3. No other GPU-intensive apps running

**Q: How much disk space does InControl need?**

A: The app itself is ~50MB. Models are stored by Ollama separately (1-8GB per model).
